My first Redux app, a movie recommender that pulls from the rapidAPI Mini movie database.

Attempted to make use of abstraction, semantic HTML, breaking down components into their specific files (services, modules etc.) and use slice/actions properly.

Need to make the fetch at the end screen look better by adding an image/descr for each movie, but besides that im happy :D
